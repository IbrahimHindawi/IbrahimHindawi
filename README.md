### Hello World, I'm Ibrahim Hindawi

I like low level programming with C and x86-64 Assembly & automation with Python! <br>
I really like game engine programming and like to develop games with custom engines + off the shelf engines. I also have a lot of experience with SideFX Houdini & Blender.

  - I’m currently working on a ARPG Rogue-like in a custom C game engine.
  - I'm currently working on building a game in x86-64 Assembler to learn more about low level programming.
